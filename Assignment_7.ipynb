    "The purpose of the try statement in Python is to define a block of code where exceptions may occur. It allows you to catch and handle exceptions gracefully, preventing them from causing your program to terminate abruptly. The try statement is typically followed by one or more except blocks, which specify how to handle different types of exceptions that may occur within the try block.\n",

    "Key Points about the try Statement:\n",
    "Error Handling: The primary purpose of the try statement is error handling. It allows you to anticipate potential errors and specify how to handle them, ensuring that your program can recover from exceptional conditions without crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception Catching: Inside the try block, you place the code that may raise exceptions. If an exception occurs during the execution of this code, Python looks for an appropriate except block to handle the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception Propagation: If an exception occurs within the try block and is not caught by any except block within the same try statement, the exception propagates up the call stack to higher levels of the program, looking for an appropriate exception handler.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graceful Error Recovery: By using try statements, you can implement graceful error recovery mechanisms, such as logging errors, displaying error messages to users, retrying operations, or providing fallback mechanisms to maintain program functionality in the presence of errors.\n",
